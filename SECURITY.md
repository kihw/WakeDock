## Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### Deployment Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for all accounts
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) when available
- Run WakeDock behind a reverse proxy with HTTPS
- Keep Docker and host systems updated
- Use dedicated service accounts with minimal privileges
- Regularly rotate secrets and API keys

#### Network Security
- Isolate WakeDock on a dedicated network segment
- Use firewalls to restrict access to necessary ports only
- Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity
- Implement rate limiting and DDoS protection

#### Container Security
- Only use trusted Docker images from verified sources
- Scan images for vulnerabilities before deployment
- Use read-only filesystems where possible
- Apply resource limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Avoid running containers as root when possible

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest and in transit
- Implement regular automated backups
- Store backups securely and test restoration procedures
- Use secrets management for sensitive configuration

### For Developers

#### Code Security
- Follow secure coding practices
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Log security events for monitoring and auditing

#### Dependency Management
- Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions
- Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Use dependency scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines
- Pin dependency versions in production

#### Testing
- Include security tests in the test suite
- Perform regular penetration testing
- Use static application security testing (SAST) tools
- Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST)

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with configurable expiration
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Password complexity requirements
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Session management and timeout

#### Input Validation
- Comprehensive input validation using Pydantic
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through output encoding
- CSRF protection for state-changing operations
- File upload restrictions and validation

#### Rate Limiting
- Configurable rate limits per endpoint and user
- IP-based and user-based rate limiting
- Sliding window and token bucket algorithms
- Automatic blocking of abusive IPs

#### Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
- X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME sniffing
- Referrer-Policy for privacy protection

#### Logging & Monitoring
- Comprehensive security event logging
- Failed authentication attempt monitoring
- Suspicious activity detection
- Integration with SIEM systems
- Alert notifications for security events

#### Container Security
