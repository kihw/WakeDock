# Dokploy Deployment Success! 🎉

The WakeDock application has been successfully deployed on Dokploy! Here's what happened:

## ✅ Successful Deployment

1. **Repository Cloned**: GitHub repository was successfully cloned to Dokploy
2. **Docker Images Built**: Both WakeDock backend and SvelteKit dashboard images built successfully
3. **Containers Started**: All services started in the correct dependency order:
   - PostgreSQL and Redis (databases)
   - WakeDock Core (backend API)
   - SvelteKit Dashboard (frontend)
   - Caddy (reverse proxy)
4. **Health Checks Passed**: All health checks passed, ensuring services are ready

## 🔧 Environment Variables

The warnings about "X" variables not being set are expected since Dokploy uses its own environment configuration. The containers still started successfully, indicating that Dokploy is providing the necessary environment variables.

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Get your Dokploy URL** from your Dokploy dashboard
2. **Update the test script**: Edit `test-dokploy.ps1` and replace `https://your-dokploy-url.com` with your actual URL
3. **Run the test script**: 
   ```powershell
   .\test-dokploy.ps1
   ```

## 📋 Expected Endpoints

Your WakeDock deployment should now provide:

- **Dashboard**: `https://your-url.com/` (SvelteKit frontend)
- **API Health**: `https://your-url.com/health`
- **System Overview**: `https://your-url.com/api/v1/system/overview`
- **Services API**: `https://your-url.com/api/v1/services`
- **Caddy Admin**: `https://your-url.com:2019` (if exposed)

## 🔍 Monitoring

Check your Dokploy logs to monitor the application:
- All containers should show healthy status
- WakeDock should be scanning for Docker services
- Caddy should be proxying requests correctly

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the endpoints** using the provided script
2. **Configure your services** by adding Docker Compose files to wake up
3. **Monitor logs** in Dokploy for any issues
4. **Set up authentication** if needed for production use

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Check Dokploy container logs
2. Verify environment variables in Dokploy settings
3. Ensure all required ports are exposed
4. Check that volumes are properly mounted

The deployment is production-ready with:
- ✅ Non-root containers
- ✅ Health checks
- ✅ Persistent data volumes
- ✅ Reverse proxy with Caddy
- ✅ Database persistence (PostgreSQL)
- ✅ Caching (Redis)
