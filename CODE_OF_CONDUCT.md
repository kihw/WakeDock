# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at
[conduct@wakedock.com](mailto:conduct@wakedock.com).
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series
of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or
permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior,  harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within
the community.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns,
please report it by contacting the project team at [conduct@wakedock.com](mailto:conduct@wakedock.com).

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing
* If there is a publicly available record (e.g., a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), include a link
* Any additional information that may be helpful

After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally within 24 hours.
If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse
themselves from handling your incident.

The project team will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting
victims of abuse.

## Community Guidelines

In addition to the Code of Conduct, we encourage all community members to follow
these guidelines for a positive experience:

### Communication

* **Be Clear and Constructive**: When providing feedback or reporting issues,
  be specific and actionable. Include relevant details and context.

* **Assume Good Intent**: Give others the benefit of the doubt. Most people
  want to contribute positively to the community.

* **Use Inclusive Language**: Choose words that are welcoming and inclusive.
  Avoid technical jargon when simpler terms would suffice.

* **Stay On Topic**: Keep discussions relevant to WakeDock and related technologies.

### Collaboration

* **Respect Different Perspectives**: Technical decisions often have multiple
  valid approaches. Be open to different viewpoints and solutions.

* **Credit Others**: Acknowledge the contributions and ideas of others.
  Give credit where it's due.

* **Share Knowledge**: Help others learn and grow. Share your expertise and
  be patient with those who are learning.

* **Collaborate Openly**: Work transparently and keep discussions in public
  channels when possible.

### Technical Standards

* **Follow Project Standards**: Adhere to coding standards, documentation
  requirements, and testing practices outlined in the project.

* **Test Your Changes**: Ensure your contributions are properly tested and
  don't break existing functionality.

* **Document Your Work**: Provide clear documentation for new features and
  changes to help others understand and maintain the code.

* **Security First**: Be mindful of security implications in your contributions.
  Report security issues privately as outlined in our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

### Issue Management

* **Search Before Creating**: Check if your issue or question already exists
  before creating a new one.

* **Provide Complete Information**: Include version numbers, error messages,
  steps to reproduce, and expected behavior.

* **Label Appropriately**: Use appropriate labels to help categorize and
  prioritize issues.

* **Follow Up**: Respond to questions and provide additional information when
  requested.

### Pull Request Guidelines

* **Keep Changes Focused**: Make pull requests focused on a single feature
  or bug fix. Large changes should be broken into smaller, reviewable pieces.

* **Write Clear Descriptions**: Explain what your changes do, why they're
  needed, and any potential impacts.

* **Update Documentation**: Include documentation updates for new features
  or behavior changes.

* **Respond to Reviews**: Address feedback promptly and professionally.
  Ask for clarification if review comments are unclear.
